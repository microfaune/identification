I have also submitted separately a sample of its normal song. . The bird is definitely an adult because it became tame  at the start of a 4-5 week period when it was a lone parent feeding a brood of fledglings, some of which also became tame. In the two weeks it has been singing  it sings the subdued song much of the time but it always switches to the normal song if there are other robins around.  The subdued song is sung from the depths of a bush, sometimes very close to the ground,  but the normal song is delivered from a more prominent vantage point.  For comparison I have submitted two recordings of its normal song.  For the two recordings of subdued song the microphone (ME266 LS12 system) was between 40 and 60 cm from the bird. 
Without seeing the robin the subdued song sounds like a robin singing 40-50 metres or more away. However, it sounds completely different  as one gets very close to the bird. The bird does not significantly open its beak during this song, although its chest moves a lot and its tail wags up and down with the singing.  I have been through all the xenocanto recordings of the robin and I think I have  listened to all those that have been designated as subsong.  Most of these are genuine sub song, i.e.\  incomplete song or fragments probably sung by young birds.  I have found  just four recordings so far, in which the recordist gives evidence of the quietness of the song, that can reliably identified as  subdued song.  In XC215370 (Klaus Fink) the bird was not seen singing,  but immediately after the recording the bird emerged from a Taxus bush and sang normal song (XC215371). In XC201447 (Frank Holzapfel) the bird was also not seen but the recordist states that the bird was whispering in the hedge.  In XC44440 and XC44439 (Stuart Fisher) the bird is tame and  it could be seen that the bird was singing quietly.",yes,no,//www.xeno-canto.org/sounds/uploaded/PDGHSSMJKI/ffts/XC387257-small.png,//www.xeno-canto.org/sounds/uploaded/PDGHSSMJKI/ffts/XC387257-med.png,//www.xeno-canto.org/sounds/uploaded/PDGHSSMJKI/ffts/XC387257-large.png,//www.xeno-canto.org/sounds/uploaded/PDGHSSMJKI/ffts/XC387257-full.png,16,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

The territorial double-note is a 'falling couplet' because the second note is lower in pitch. I transcribe it as 'dee feat'. Incidentally, although each rendition of 'dee-feat' on this clip contains both parts of the double note, from time to time a Chaffinch will drop the first half of the double note ('dee-') and continue with just the second note ('feat'). 

Classic contact notes - given throughout the year - come first. So there is a 'pink' [0:01; 0:04] and the same note doubled to 'pink, pink' [0:07; 0:15; 0:18, 0:26; 0:29]. The default territorial 'dee-feat' (also referred to in books as 'rain song') is at 0:10; 0:21; 0:31; and, five final repetitions, from 0:44  to the end. A Robin makes quiet ticks at various points [0:07 is where it starts, although overlapped by the Chaffinch at this moment] and a Wren gives a total of ten alarm chitters, beginning at 0:27 until the 42nd second.",yes,no,//www.xeno-canto.org/sounds/uploaded/TYEQKORVXJ/ffts/XC553147-small.png,//www.xeno-canto.org/sounds/uploaded/TYEQKORVXJ/ffts/XC553147-med.png,//www.xeno-canto.org/sounds/uploaded/TYEQKORVXJ/ffts/XC553147-large.png,//www.xeno-canto.org/sounds/uploaded/TYEQKORVXJ/ffts/XC553147-full.png,20,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

EQ adjusted below 2000 Hz using Audacity to reduce road noise. I think the bird stopped singing just one verse after I stopped recording. 

There is plenty of mimicry here, but I find it's only noticeable if you start playing back the track in certain places. Most of the mimicking seems to take place in the quieter endings to each verse. Have a listen to the links below. If you can hear any more, or think I've made any mistakes then please press ""discuss"" to leave a comment.

Letztes  Jahr (2013) wartete ein Mauersegler fast 14 Tage auf die  Ankunft des zweiten Mauerseglers,
vermutlich auf das Weibchen.  
Das der/die NEUE ankam war nicht zu verkennen und ich  startete sofort ein Video. 
Fast eine Stunde dauerte es bis auch der zweite Segler in den Kasten zurückkam. 
Dann begann ein Paarungsritual das zum Teil sehr heftig und laut durchgeführt wurde.
Diese Stimmen waren auch für das Mikrofon zu laut und sind fast unbrauchbar.
Aber zum Ende hörte ich leise Stimmen, die von den Seglern nicht oft zu hören sind.

The switch from spring-sown crops to autumn planting effectively removed a whole community of seeding weeds that were part of the bird's diet. Throw in general intensification, the use of herbicides and the usual arsenal of 'Silent Spring' chemicals and it is no surprise that many bird populations are rapidly disappearing across Irish farmland. Stock Doves colonised Ireland from Britain. Occasionally some were noted in winter (the first in 1875) but by the early twentieth century breeding was occurring in many counties, except the far west. In the new millennium one of the few reliable places to see the species is on the Copeland Islands off the coast of County Down. Here farming is either not practised or consists of sheep grazing. The land is not subject to any input of chemicals, nor is it ploughed. Unfortunately, the largest island is used as a Pheasant shoot and perhaps some Stock Doves are also killed. In any event, all the Stock Doves are extremely wary. They nest in burrows, mainly rabbit burrows. The bird in this recording was not seen. I heard it calling (the call is also what passes for song) when I was inside a tent. I suspect it was perching in low bushes and was returning to either exchange incubation with its mate or, possibly, to feed its own young. All this is speculation, of course. The same bird was doing the same thing when I camped in precisely the same spot a week ago. During its calling session - the bird was in the vicinity for up to an hour at a time - the gaps between each burst of calls averaged from 20 seconds to a minute or so. I have edited the gaps. Each burst of calling was fascinating. The bird took two, maybe three notes, to 'get going'. These preliminary notes were close to just one syllable. The first proper note always has two (albeit subtle) syllables. Complete bursts contained from 6 to 11 double-notes. Although difficult to hear the minor distinctions, as the phrases were uttered, the middle and later double-notes were just a bit more disyllabic. In fact, the final one or two notes (sometimes only the terminal note) tended to revert to being less clearly disyllabic. The wing-whirr (that is, the flap of wing-beats) was softer than in Rock Dove and can be heard at 0:14. Other birds that feature are, in chronological order, Lesser Black-backed Gull (L. f. graelsii), Wren (juvenile), Water Rail, briefly at 0:10 and (overlapping beginning of Stock Dove call) at 1:17, Pheasant, Curlew and Jackdaw. A few deep coo notes were also given (this seems to be the only other sound in the bird's vocabulary) but were too quiet to be easily discerned.",no,no,//www.xeno-canto.org/sounds/uploaded/TYEQKORVXJ/ffts/XC190176-small.png,//www.xeno-canto.org/sounds/uploaded/TYEQKORVXJ/ffts/XC190176-med.png,//www.xeno-canto.org/sounds/uploaded/TYEQKORVXJ/ffts/XC190176-large.png,//www.xeno-canto.org/sounds/uploaded/TYEQKORVXJ/ffts/XC190176-full.png,10,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

I left my recorder among the tree foliage in close proximity to the birds. As well as the typical high-pitched and penetrating 'zeep' call of Redwing [three times over the first eight seconds, then really clear at 0:10; next, much quieter, at 0:13 and, quite clear, at 0:17 - close to the eighteenth second] the more Blackbird-like, chacking alarm call (of Redwing) can also be heard [0:09; 0:17; 0:30]. Of more interest is the comparison between the Redwing's 'jack' and the equivalent call from Blackbird. To me, the Redwing's call is more emphatic and indignant (it sounds as though the bird has just sat on a pin) and the Blackbird's note is lower, more muffled and less panicky.  Examples of Blackbird 'chucks' are at 0:01; 0:05; 0:08 and 0:15. A nice comparison of the two species can be heard between the seventh and ninth seconds: Blackbird at just before the eighth second, followed by Redwing. Another sequence that provides a great comparison is from the 26th second to the end of the clip, about nine seconds later. The first two calls are from Blackbird, the next is Redwing, the last three are Blackbird.",yes,no,//www.xeno-canto.org/sounds/uploaded/TYEQKORVXJ/ffts/XC505707-small.png,//www.xeno-canto.org/sounds/uploaded/TYEQKORVXJ/ffts/XC505707-med.png,//www.xeno-canto.org/sounds/uploaded/TYEQKORVXJ/ffts/XC505707-large.png,//www.xeno-canto.org/sounds/uploaded/TYEQKORVXJ/ffts/XC505707-full.png,47,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Over the first five seconds (before the first notes from the Song Thrush) the thin 'seep' calls are made by a Meadow Pipit. During, roughly, the last seven years, Inishbofin's Song Thrush  population has increased spectacularly - because nest-robbing Magpies have been removed.  One measure of the current Song Thrush density can be gauged by there being two other songsters in the background of this clip (although one is hard to discern).  Another local phenomenon is the incorporation of a Greenshank imitation into the song. One bird began this in the early spring of 2017, after a vocal Greenshank wintered within earshot of local Song Thrushes, and the habit spread across most of the island. Greenshank imitations can be heard at 0:14 and 0:43. Although the Greenshank imitation is delivered as a full-volume component, other imitations of other species are very quiet. Indeed, some are virtually inaudible until picked up by a recording device. In the clip, it is possible to hear an imitation of Common Snipe from 0:36 (five repeats over the next two seconds) and Arctic Tern at 0:46 and 0:49. In fact, I have heard more than one Song Thrush utter imitations of Common Snipe and Arctic Tern that were clearly audible - but I have not yet managed to record them.

The full story of how one of Inishbofin's Song Thrushes incorporated a Greenshank impersonation into its song that, through being overheard, was then copied by other Song Thrushes, is contained in this Facebook post :
